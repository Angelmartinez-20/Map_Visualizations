# Python Map Visualizations

Welcome to my map visualization repository!

In this repository, I have different Jupyter notebooks where I explore how to plot maps using various Python libraries.

* `cholera_outbreak.ipynb` uses folium library
* `ca_unemployment.ipynb` uses bokeh library
* `world_gdp.ipynb` uses plotly library
